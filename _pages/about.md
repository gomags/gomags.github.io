Hey, thanks for visiting my website. I'm Aayush - a recent (2021) graduate from the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/). I'm a Machine Learning Engineer/Data Scientist with over two years of experience working in fast-scaling & high-performance teams.

Currently, I am working as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Stats Perform](https://www.statsperform.com/) aiming to build a platform to help Data Scientists and AI Scientists in productionizing their models. I have also recently worked as a Student Researcher at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/) and at [TerraClear](https://www.terraclear.com/) as a Software Engineer. I have a Bachelor of Technology degree in Computer Science from the [University of Mumbai](https://kjsce.somaiya.edu/en).

I'm super enthusiastic about learning new technologies and how these can be best used in my job! I often gravitate towards project making me think out of the box and am always up for any new and exciting opportunities coming my way.

Oh, and also, I'm a sports buff and a HUGE Formula 1 fan. Hit me up if you want to talk sports, machine learning, data science, or anything fun in life! :)
