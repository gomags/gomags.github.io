Hello, I'm Gopi - a current graduate student from the University of Southern California. I'm a Data Scientist with over three years of experience working in fast-scaling & high-performance teams.

I have recently worked as a Data Science Intern at [Gopuff](https://www.gopuff.com/go/about-us) and at [Mu Sigma](https://www.mu-sigma.com/) as a Data Scientist. I have a Bachelor of Technology degree in Electronics and Communications from the [Amrita University, Coimbatore](https://www.amrita.edu/).

I have a strong passion for exploring and adopting new technologies and discovering innovative ways to apply them to my work. I particularly enjoy taking on projects that challenge me to think creatively and outside the box. I am constantly on the lookout for new and exciting opportunities to further develop my skills and broaden my knowledge in the field.

Hit me up if you want to talk formula one, photogrpahy, machine learning, data science, or anything fun in life! :)
